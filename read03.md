# Git Tutorial summry
do you know what is Version Control no?well the Version Control is
a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control
and local Version Control is something programmers created Many years ago for the reaso being entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files
Centralized Version Control or (cvcs) is The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions This system entails
 a single server storing all changes and file versions 
 # so what is git?
 Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project
 Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it
 git also tracks the changes you made Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit
 the story of git came to to be 
 there so many developers using this thing called BitKeeper froom 2002 untill 2005
 Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the BitKeeper, began creating Git becuse people stoped using the old BitKeeper because
 due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeperâ€™s
 With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper
 Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects
 possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design
 Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world
 and thats how the git came to be on this earth
