hello today am going to be talking about
# the use javascript loops (if;while)
you use loops if you added like a question box but he didnt answer it it will let him in but we put the loops so it will keep on asking and asking untill he answer that is the basic use of loops or in this case the ( loop while)
and for the (if) loop case we need it for more then one items lets say a shooping list you want 10 times of something so we put the (if loop)
in there to give us that function
now this is just the run down of the loops for now later we will go in depth
with this thing
