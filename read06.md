## what i learned using javascript and jQuery
i learned that javescript is like the stand anlone ecu for the car 
so javescript will be the brains of the web site 
you can make java script do alot of things for the ones i have learnd for now
you can do loops usinf the codes (if,while)
you can make it ask a qusetion before letting you in 
you can set it to make it say a greeting on diffrinet times 
and you can do a lot of stuff more that i have yet to learn and so on and so forth
thats it for now good bye and i hope you enjoy
