summry on the fuction of css
css is like the paint for and old crapp house
because you know no one would to like to live in an old crappy house 
so we use paint
and paint for html case is css 
we css to add colors like background color or the color of the fonts 
or to change the size of the text
css is much more than this 
its like if the bread was html the butter would css and the honey is javascript
thats what i think of css at least 
and everybody has there own opinin on things for me i like css because its simple and super easy to work with 
its easier then puting a turbo on a car 
but css is like the engine of the car and html is like the shell and javascript is like the stand alone ecu of the car 
every body likes some bobs and bang in there car right
